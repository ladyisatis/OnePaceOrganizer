# One Pace Organizer

This program renames all One Pace video files to a format that is compatible for both Plex and Jellyfin, and either updates the metadata if running on Plex, or generates metadata files for use with Jellyfin. Comes in both console/terminal and desktop GUI program flavors. [See the Wiki for more information](https://github.com/ladyisatis/OnePaceOrganizer/wiki), including screenshots, FAQ, and how to use this program on Windows, Mac, or Linux.

These .nfo files for Jellyfin are automatically generated by the program itself. Also, this is not an addon for Plex, and Plex does not need any addons for this to work as this program uses the Plex API to update all of the metadata.

By the end, on your Plex or Jellyfin setup, you should have:

- Posters for the Anime and Season/Arcs automatically set for you
- TV Show, Season/Arc, and Episode metadata automatically set
- All One Pace files renamed to be recognized by Plex

You can also re-run the program when new One Pace releases for quick renaming, and this does not require every single One Pace release ever released in order to function. If there's no added metadata in the repository for an episode, like say, the One Pace team just released an episode 2 minutes ago? It will look into the .mkv file and attempt to create the metadata for you.
