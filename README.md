# One Pace Organizer

This program renames all One Pace video files to a format that is compatible for both Plex and Jellyfin, and either updates the metadata if running on Plex, or generates metadata files for use with Jellyfin. Comes in both console/terminal and desktop GUI program flavors. [See the Wiki for more information, including screenshots, updating metadata, and how to use this program on Windows, Mac, or Linux.](https://github.com/ladyisatis/OnePaceOrganizer/wiki).

These .nfo files for Jellyfin are automatically generated by the program itself. Also, this is not an addon for Plex, and Plex does not need any addons for this to work as this program uses the Plex API to update all of the metadata.

By the end, on your Plex or Jellyfin setup, you should have:

- Posters for the Anime and Season/Arcs automatically set for you
- TV Show, Season/Arc, and Episode metadata automatically set
- All One Pace files renamed to be recognized by Plex

You can also re-run the program when new One Pace releases for quick renaming, and this does not require every single One Pace release ever released in order to function. If there's no added metadata in the repository for an episode, like say, the One Pace team just released an episode 2 minutes ago? It will look into the .mkv file and attempt to create the metadata for you.

**IMPORTANT:** For applications depending on this project for metadata, the format of the amalgamated metadata file [has both moved as well as changed formats](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ladyisatis/one-pace-metadata/refs/heads/main/data.json) for 1.0.0, as rewriting this whole project made things a little more efficient at the cost of trying to change around things. This is the _only_ time this change in both location and file format will happen, and there _should_ be no more breaking changes in this format.

## Pixeldrain

Episodes from Pixeldrain that are separated into "English Subtitles" and "English Dub" are unsupported as there's too many to create CRC32 metadata files for, and no automatic way to tell which video files from Pixeldrain correspond to which episode. You're welcome to download the `episodes` folder from the [metadata repository](https://github.com/ladyisatis/one-pace-metadata) and put it inside the `metadata` folder, search for the corresponding [episode file](https://github.com/ladyisatis/one-pace-metadata/tree/main/episodes) and copy its contents [using the instructions here](https://github.com/ladyisatis/one-pace-metadata?tab=readme-ov-file#yaml-episodesyml-arcsyml-tvshowyml), however that may take a lot of time compared to just grabbing the video files the non-Pixeldrain way.

## Contributing

Contributions via Pull Requests are always welcome if I miss a bug or want another feature added in, want to contribute a program icon, etc.
